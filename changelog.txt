matrixObj v1.2.1


Matrix
Bugs Fix
	- random_constant_matrix() function
	- Determinant, Minor and Cofactor of a 1x1 Matrix
	- Raise error for 0x0 matrix generation
	- Indices exception (Fixing negative indexes)

Optimization
	- Gaussian Elimination method for computing Determinant

New Methods
	- reducing to upper trangular matrix
	- reducing to lower trangular matrix
	- minor at i,j position
	- cofactor at i,j position
	- can now delete slice of columns

AugMatrix
New Properties
	- _Matrix_align (Alignment value for the Augmatrix's full matrix)
	- full_matrix (Return the AugMatrix as a Matrix) (removed!!!)
	- Type Casting AugMatrix to Matrix
